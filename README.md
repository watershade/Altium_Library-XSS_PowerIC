## About this library
I have collects many power chips (LDO/DC-DC chips) in my recently project. And I make an altium designer integrated library to collect them. Some of them maybe low-quality and some of them move from other tools(for example Ultralibrarian) or websites.
I will move some components from MyICs here.

## Initial Commit
There are only a few power chips (LDO/DC-DC chips). I will move many more from MyICs.

## v0.1
I have move LDO chip,DC-DC chip modules and other power ic(not include mosfet/diode) from MyICs here.
